# Supply Chain Intelligence Platform

A full-stack analytics platform designed to monitor, predict, and analyze shipment delays across supply chain operations. The platform provides real-time shipment monitoring, risk intelligence, predictive analytics, and carrier anomaly detection.

---

## Project Overview

The **Supply Chain Intelligence Platform** helps logistics teams make data-driven decisions by providing:

* Shipment tracking and monitoring
* Delay prediction using Machine Learning
* Route risk analysis
* Carrier anomaly detection
* Operational KPI dashboards

This system combines **FastAPI**, **MongoDB**, **ReactJS**, **Docker**, and **Machine Learning models** into a unified platform.

---

## Features

### 1. Operations Overview Dashboard

Displays:

* Total Shipments
* Total Delayed Shipments
* Total In Transit Shipments
* Average Delay Days
* Shipment Status Distribution Chart
* Top 5 High-Risk Routes Chart

API Used:

```bash
GET /dashboard/summary
```

---

### 2. Shipment Monitor

Features:

* Shipment data table
* Filters by:

  * Status
  * Carrier
  * Risk Level
* Pagination support
* Clickable rows for shipment details modal

API Used:

```bash
GET /shipments
GET /shipments/{shipment_id}
```

---

### 3. Predict Shipment

Users can input shipment details and get:

* Delay prediction
* Delay probability
* Estimated delay days
* Risk level
* Progress bar visualization

API Used:

```bash
POST /shipments/predict
```

---

### 4. Carrier & Route Intelligence

Displays:

#### Carrier Intelligence:

* Carrier anomaly detection
* Delay rate
* Average delay days

#### Route Intelligence:

* Route risk score
* Historical delay rate
* Customs hold rate
* Sortable risk score

APIs Used:

```bash
GET /carriers/anomalies
GET /routes/risk
```
